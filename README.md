# Pac-Man on LandTiger Board

This project is a simplified version of the classic **Pac-Man** game, implemented on a **LandTiger development board**. It was created as part of the **"Computer Architectures"** course in the Master's program in Computer Engineering at the **Polytechnic University of Turin**.

## Overview

The goal of the project was to explore low-level programming and hardware interfacing by implementing a recognizable game using the features provided by the LandTiger board. The game logic, display, and controls were all developed from scratch or adapted to the hardware constraints of the platform.

## Features

All the feature are written in [`task1.pdf`](./task1.pdf) and [`task2.pdf`](./task2.pdf), as I have implemented all of them to get the maximum points.
Due to the tight deadline and the overlap with exams from other courses, the project has several imperfections and simplifications.

## Development

- **Platform**: LandTiger LPC1768 Board
- **Language**: C
- **Tools**: Keil ÂµVision and LandTiger Emulator
